├── Google OAuth Login (React Context + Token Handling)
│   ├── Uses @react-oauth/google for authentication
│   ├── Stores token in context and persists user session
│   └── Restricts access to protected routes
│
├── Segment Builder (Rules Engine + Dynamic Form UI)
│   ├── Users create audience segments using flexible AND/OR logic
│   ├── UI supports nested logical conditions and validation
│   └── Uses react-hook-form for controlled form management
│
├── Campaign Manager (Delivery Triggers + API Logging)
│   ├── Triggers new campaigns via backend after segment save
│   ├── Logs sent/failed messages into communication_log
│   └── Handles optimistic UI feedback for delivery status
│
├── AI Assistant (Prompt Input → Message Suggestions)
│   ├── Integrates with OpenAI API to generate campaign messages
│   ├── Accepts plain text objectives and returns 2–3 variants
│   └── Allows user to select one to proceed with
│
└── Campaign History Dashboard (Paginated + Stats View)
    ├── Fetches and displays campaign logs from backend
    ├── Shows sent, failed counts and delivery receipts
